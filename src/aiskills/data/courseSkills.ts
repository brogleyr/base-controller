Emphasis is placed on characterizing sampling sites; understanding contaminant transport; developing and following sampling plans for the collection of various media; documenting field activities; following proper lab techniques and safety; and interpreting lab reports. Upon completion, students should be able to describe significant environmental regulations applicable to the marine environment, classes and typical sources of contaminants, and current sampling and laboratory techniques and quality control measures.",
