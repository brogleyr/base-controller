    name: 'Operations & Project Management',

    code: 'MGT 5020',

    description: 'The ability to effectively manage a business includes a complete understanding of the underlying operations and supply chain linkages. This course is designed to equip students with the foundation of theoretical knowledge and skills necessary to understand the core areas of operations management. Toward this end, this course integrates textbook learning (through readings and lectures) with real world examples (through discussion boards and case studies) to provide a full understanding of Operations. The course is also designed to encourage participation in discussion of student’s job experiences as they relate to core operations topics. Often we are involved with developing a new system, a new product, planning an event, or participating in an undertaking that we cannot simply repeat things we have done in our past experience. These are ‘one-offs’ or Projects. Projects are major undertakings that have a defined life time (i.e. limited duration) and a specific outcome. As such, they require a unique approach to management and administration, it is important to understand and appreciate the techniques and concepts used for successful project management. This course covers some of the issues related to projects, working on project teams and tools used for managing projects. Students will be able to describe strategic dimensions of the Operations function. Students will be able to recognize the basic terminology, fundamental tools and concepts of Operations Management. Students will be able to differentiate the implications of the same techniques, tools and theories of Operations Management in the manufacturing and service industries’ context. Students will be able to identify and evaluate a range of frameworks appropriate for analysis of operating systems of the firm. Students will be able to describe the project life cycle, project selection, project environment, and approval process. Students will be able to explain the role of the project manager in initiating and completing a project. Students will be able to identify the steps that must be taken to complete projects on time and on budget. Students will be able to identify Project Team Dynamics issues.
